# Port of the "blingbling" Enlightenment theme to e20

The original theme was created by Rasterman. Further work on it was done by 'verdegal37' and published [here](http://e17-stuff.org/content/show.php?content=108719).

With considerable help from Duma I have started porting the theme to e20 (hence also for e19).

The Elementary code is from a derivation of this theme, "R-Volcano R-E19" by 'rpil' from [here](http://e17-stuff.org/content/show.php/R-Volcano+R-E19?content=167690). It has been modified only to the point that the most e20 dialogs look good enough, expect some inconsistencies in e apps.

Full credit goes to the artists, in particular 'rpil' and 'Duma'. My role is limited to technical adaptation and minor fixes, since I really want to use this theme.

Please note that this is work in progress and not yet complete.
