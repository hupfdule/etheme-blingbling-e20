# Port of the "blingbling" Enlightenment theme to e20

The original theme was created by Rasterman. Further work on it was done by 'verdegal37' and published [here](http://e17-stuff.org/content/show.php?content=108719).

With considerable help from Duma I have started porting the theme to e20 (hence also for e19).

Full credit goes to the artists and Duma. My role is limited to technical adaptation, since I really want to use this theme.

As the original, this theme is licensed under the [GPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html).

Please note that this is work in progress and not yet complete.
