# BlingBling theme for enlightenment

BlingBling Enlightenment theme is the old default theme for Enlightenment:

It is intended to be conservative and still show off some aspects of Enlightenment such as the ability to animate transitions and do different layouts for objects. 

The original theme was created by Rasterman. Further work on it was done by 'verdegal37' and published [here](http://e17-stuff.org/content/show.php?content=108719).

With considerable help from Duma I have started porting the theme to e20 (hence also for e19).
The theme _should_ be compatible with E version 20 upwards, but it has only be tested with (current) version 24.

From version 1.0.0 on there is support for rpm packaging. Ready-built packages for Fedora can be obtained from the [github page](https://github.com/mbert/etheme-blingbling-e20/releases). The spec is implemented in a simplistic way that should allow using it to create packages for other rpm-based distributions without any changes.

The Elementary code is from a derivation of this theme, "R-Volcano R-E19" by 'rpil' from [here](http://e17-stuff.org/content/show.php/R-Volcano+R-E19?content=167690). It has been modified only to the point that the most e20 dialogs look good enough, expect some inconsistencies in e apps.

This theme has been fixed and extended considerably by Å tefanUram 'thewaiter'.

Full credit goes to the artists, in particular 'rpil', 'Duma' and 'thewaiter'. My role is limited to technical adaptation and minor fixes, since I really want to use this theme.
